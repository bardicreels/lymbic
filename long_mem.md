Failure Description:
I failed to notice a missing entry in the video_list.json file when comparing it to the actual files in the data directory. This oversight occurred despite having access to the file listing and the JSON content.

Solution:
The issue was resolved by carefully comparing the file listing with the JSON content and adding the missing entry.

Lessons Learned:
1. Always cross-reference provided file listings with data structures like JSON.
2. Don't assume the completeness or accuracy of provided data without verification.
3. Pay closer attention to details, especially when dealing with file listings and data integrity.
4. Implement a systematic approach to compare file listings with data structures.

Future Prevention Strategies:
1. Develop a mental checklist for data verification tasks:
   a. Compare the number of items in the file listing with the JSON entries.
   b. Cross-reference each file in the listing with the corresponding JSON entry.
   c. Look for patterns in file names and ensure all expected entries are present.
2. When possible, suggest or implement automated tools to keep data structures in sync with file systems.
3. Always double-check work, especially when dealing with data integrity issues.
4. When errors are pointed out, take time to understand the root cause and document the learning process.

By following these strategies, I aim to improve accuracy and attention to detail in future tasks involving data verification and file management.
